## üòç Networks where you can deploy ink! contracts

### Production

- [Shiden](https://shiden.astar.network): Kusama parachain by the Astar team, contains the `pallet-contracts` and thus supports ink! contracts.

### Testnets

- [Rococo Smart Contracts Parachain](https://ink.substrate.io/testnet/): Operated by the developers behind ink! and Substrate's [`pallet-contracts`](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/tree/master/frame/contracts).
- [Shibuya](https://docs.astar.network/maintain/collator/shibuya-network): Testnet parachain by [Astar](https://astar.network/), connected to a custom relaychain also maintained by Astar.
- [Phala](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fpoc5.phala.network%2Fws#/explorer): Further documentation can be found [here](https://wiki.phala.network/en-us/build/developer/fat-contract-tutorial/).
- [Aleph Zero](https://alephzero.org/blog/aleph-zero-smart-contracts-testnet/): Support for ink! smart contracts on their testnet.
- [peaq network](https://www.peaq.network/agung-testnet): ink! smart contracts are live on their testnet.
- [t3rn](https://www.t3rn.io/): Their testnet is called t0rn, the faucet can be found [here](https://dev.net.t3rn.io/faucet/).
